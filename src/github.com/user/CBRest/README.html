The following can be used in muli-cluster XDCR testing to understand latency between multiple "cluster hops".
For example, if we have four clusters in a bidirection ring; A->B->C->A. You can start the GETbulk first on cluster C which will start reading pathologically for a set of keys. When this process finds the key the given document is updated with a timestamp (getstamp).
Subsequently, the POSTbulk is then started on cluster A which will create the documents the reader is looking for. As each document is created a timestamp is added (upstamp). Based on these time stamps a profile can be defined of latencies between cluster replication.
